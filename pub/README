OK, so here's how the new stuff works.

You'll need to install the Template Toolkit. This can be as simple as

  $ perl -MCPAN -e'install Template'

Now you've got all of the input pages in ./in and a handful of library
templates in ./lib. We'll use this to build the output files (i.e. the
web site) in ./out. To do this we use a program called 'ttree' which
comes with TT. 'ttree' needs a config file to tell it which directories
to use. There's a .ttreerc included in the project. To tell 'ttree' to
use this on instead of one in your home directory (which is its default
action) you need to see the TTREERC variable like this:

  $ export TTREERC=./.ttreerc

This works in a modern bash-like shell. For other things, you're on your
own!

Now, you can rebuild the site from the input templates just by typing

  $ ttree

See how it told you what it was doing.

Now the FAQs are stored in another directory. They are in ../docs. And
they're not in a format that makes it particularly easy to integrate them
with the rest of the site. So I've written the faq2html.pl program that
takes care of that. You'll need to install Andy Wardley's excellent
Pod::POM module in order to use it. Just running faq2html.pl from the
pub directory will add three new templates to the ./in directory which 
are constructed from the three faq pod files in ../docs.

So. Finally to generate the whole site you need to do the following.

* Edit the files in ./in to make any required changes.
* cvs commit and/or cvs update
* cd to the pub directory
* ./faq2html.pl (to add the faq templates to ./in)
* export TTREERC=./.ttreerc
* ttree
* You've now got the new site in ./out. Use scp to copy it to sf

Let me know if you have any questions.
