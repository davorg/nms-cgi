There are a number of variables that you can change in rand_image.pl which
alter the way that the program works.

            This should be set to 1 whilst you are installing
                and testing the script. Once the script is live you
                should change it to 0. When set to 1, errors will
                be output to the browser. This is a security risk and
                should not be used when the script is live.

         <paragraph>
            The list of images that the random image is chosen from.
                Each image has three parts to its definition:

                file - the URL of the image file
                alt  - some brief text to describe the image
                url  - An optional link URL (see

            Set this value to 1 to log which image is returned each time
                the program runs.

            If this value is true (i.e. 1) and the chosen image has
                a 'url' component, then the image will be displayed as a
                link to the given URL.

  <installation>
      <paragraph>
ssi_rand_image is installed simply by copying the file ssi_rand_image.pl.pl 
into your cgi-bin directory. If you don't know where your cgi-bin directory 
is, then please ask your system administrator
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
You may need to rename ssi_rand_image.pl to ssi_rand_image.cgi. Again, your
system administrator will know if this is the case.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
You will probably need to turn on execute permissions to the file. You can
do this by running the command "chmod +x ssi_rand_image.pl" from your command
line. If you don't have command line access to your web server then there
will probably be an equivalent function in your file transfer program.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
Then, edit your HTML files and change all the images that you want to
be randomized to:
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<!--#exec cgi="http://your.host.com/cgi-bin/ssi_rand_image.pl"-->
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
This is just an example, so be sure to insert the correct URL of your
ssi_rand_image.pl installation.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
Note: As this is a "Server Side Include" you will need to ensure that your
web server has been configured to support SSI. Also, it's possible that you
may need to rename any files that include SSI calls to give them a different
extension. A common choice is .shtml. Your system administrator will be able
to help you with these details.
