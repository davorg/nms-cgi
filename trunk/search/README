SUMMARY

Simple Search is a simple search engine designed for a quick search of a website.

FILES

In this distribution, you will find four files:

search.pl      - The main Perl script
README         - This file. Instructions on how to install and use search
countdown.html - A sample HTML document demonstrating how to use search
MANIFEST       - List of files

CONFIGURATION

There are a number of variables that you can change in search.pl which
alter the way that the program works.

$DEBUGGING          - This should be set to 1 whilst you are installing
                      and testing the script. Once the script is live you
                      should change it to 0. When set to 1, errors will
                      be output to the browser. This is a security risk and
                      should not be used when the script is live.

$basedir            - This is the base directory for the files you want to search.  
                      This should as closest as possible to the root directory; it 
                      should encompass everything you want searched.  Files and folders 
                      you want blocked should be placed in the @blocked array; 
                      everything else will be searched. Also note that this is a 
                      directory on the server, not the web.

$baseurl            - This is exactly equivalent to $basedir except that it is a URL
                      not a file path. In plain english, this variable will be used in 
                      generating links to the results.

@files              - This array contains the file types to be searched. There are a 
                      few markers you can use:

                          * - wildcard.  Use to fill in holes, such as: sear*.html  
                              Use it to tighten up the search criteria.
                          / - directory marker.
                          . - use to indicate file exstension.

                      If there are no markers in the element, it will be treated as a 
                      file extension; All files with that file extension that match the 
                      search will be "found".

$title              - This is the title that you want displayed on the search results
                      page.

$title_url          - The title on the results page will be a link. This is the URL
                      that it links to.

$search_url         - The URL of your main search page. This is included on the 
                      results page so that users can begin a new search.

@blocked            - This is an array of files that will be blocked. Full names, 
                      relative to $basedir are needed.  These files will NEVER show up 
                      in any search.

INSTALLATION

Simple Search is installed simply by copying the file search.pl into your
cgi-bin directory. If you don't know where your cgi-bin directory is, then
please ask your system administrator.

You may need to rename search.pl to search.cgi. Again, your system
administrator will know if this is the case.

You will probably need to turn on execute permissions to the file. You can
do this by running the command "chmod +x search.pl" from your command
line. If you don't have command line access to your web server then there
will probably be an equivalent function in your file transfer program.

Simple Search will scan and search all directories and subdirectories from a
start point.  There are 3 different parameters that can be passed to it:
case, bool, and terms.
$case  - can be Sensitive or Insensitive.  Default is Insensitive.
$bool  - Type of search, although only affects searches with multiple terms.
         Can be AND or OR.  Default is OR.
$terms - the terms that will be searched.

See the search.html example bundled with Simple Search of how to fully construct
a form to use with simple search.  Also note that a small form can be embedded into
a page using a construct similar to this:

<form method="POST" action="/cgi-bin/search.pl">
<input type="text" name="terms" size="20" />
<input type="submit" />
</form>
