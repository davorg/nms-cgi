    <introduction>
    
      <paragraph>
There are a number of variables that you can change in search.pl which
alter the way that the program works.  $basedir and $baseurl are the two
most important variables, and must be altered to refer to your website.

    <variables>

      <variable>
    
        <var_name>
    $DEBUGGING

        </var_name>
        
        <description>
        
          <paragraph>
        For debugging and/or testing purposes set this variable to 1;
        otherwise set it to 0.  When set to 1, errors will be output
        to the browser (however, this is a security risk, therefore it
        should not be set to 1 when the script is ready for public use).
        
          </paragraph>

      <variable>

          <paragraph>
        Simple Search offers some facilities that are not present in the
        original MSA Simple Search:  if this variable is set to 1 then
        the program will work in a way that is similar to the MSA one, if
        it is set to 0 then the extra facilities will become available.
     
          </paragraph>
    
        </description>

      </variable>

      <variable>
   
        <var_name>
    $basedir
   
        </var_name>
   
        <description>
   
          <paragraph>
        This is the base directory (where each search will start);
        hence it should encompass everything you want searched.
        Files and directories you want blocked from the search should
        be placed in the @blocked array (described below); everything
        else will be searched.  The base directory and all directories
        below it (that you want searched) must be world readable and
        executable.  For example, this variable might be set to
        /home/larry/public_html/articles
    
          </paragraph>

      <variable>

        <var_name>
    $baseurl

        </var_name>
    
        <description>
       
          <paragraph>
        This is the base URL, which is the URL relative to $basedir
        (mentioned above).  This variable will be used in generating
        links (URLs) relative to the files found containing the text
        search for.  For example, this variable might be set to
        http://www.webhost.com/~larry/articles

        <description>
        
          <paragraph>
        This array contains the files to be searched.  There are a few
        special symbols you can use to describe those files.
        
          </paragraph>
        
          <paragraph>
            *   The star is a wildcard symbol.  It matches zero or more
                characters.  For example, '*.html' would match all files
                ending with '.html', while a single '*' would match every
                file.
        
          </paragraph>
        
          <paragraph>
            /   The forward slash is a directory delimiter.  It is used
                to separate directories of a single path.
        
          </paragraph>
        
          <paragraph>
            .   The period is used to indicate a file extension (usually
                an acronym used to identify the contents of a file).  For
                example, a file with the '.html' suffix usually contains
                HTML (the language used to write webpages).
        
          </paragraph>
        
          <paragraph>
        All files with a listed file extension that contain the text
        searched for will be displayed in the result of the search.
        
          </paragraph>

      <variable>
   
        <var_name>
    $title
    
        </var_name>
    
        <description>
        
          <paragraph>
        This is the title that will be displayed on the search results
        page, and it will also be used as the text of the link intended
        to point back to your main webpage.
        
          </paragraph>

        <var_name>
    $title_url
    
        </var_name>
    
        <description>
        
          <paragraph>
        This variable is intended to be set to the URL of your main web-
        page.  The associated hypertext will be the value of $title, and
        it will be displayed on the results page so that users can link 
        back to the search page (to perform another search).
        
          </paragraph>
     
        </description>

      <variable>
   
        <var_name>
    $search_url
    
        </var_name>
    
        <description>
        
          <paragraph>
        The URL of search.html. This is included on the results page
        so that users can link back to the search page to perform a new
        search.
        
          </paragraph>

      <variable>
   
        <var_name>
    @blocked
    
        </var_name>
    
        <description>
        
          <paragraph>
        This is an array of files that will be blocked.  Full names,
        relative to $basedir are needed.  These files will NEVER show up
        in any search results.  If $emulate_matts_code is set to 0 then
        this may contain regular expressions to match the files to be
        blocked.
        
          </paragraph>
     
        </description>

      </variable>

      <variable>
   
        <var_name>
    @subdirs
    
        </var_name>
    
        <description>
        
          <paragraph>
        This is an array of sub-directories beneath $basedir that you
        might want to restrict your search to - see the description of
        the 'directory' CGI form parameter below for more information.
        This variable is only used if $emulate_matts_code is set to 0.
        
          </paragraph>
     
        </description>

      </variable>

      <variable>
   
        <var_name>
    $no_prune
    
        </var_name>
    
        <description>
        
          <paragraph>
        If $emulate_matts_code is set to 0 and and this is set to 1 then,
        rather than having to specify each level of sub-directory you want
        to search in @files, the search will go down into the sub-directories.
        If you do set this you probably want to be more careful of what you
        put in @blocked so that you are only searching in the things that
        you want.

  </configuration>
  
  <installation>
      
    <paragraph>
Simple Search is installed simply by copying the file search.pl into
your cgi-bin directory.  If you don't know the location of your cgi-bin
directory, then please ask your system administrator.

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
Depending on how the HTTP server is configured, you may need to rename
search.pl to search.cgi.  Again, your system administrator will know if
this is the case.

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
You will probably need to turn on execute permissions to the file
search.pl.  If you have shell access to the HTTP server, you can do this
by running the command `chmod +x search.pl` from the command line.
If you don't have command line access then there will probably be an
equivalent function (to change file mode) in your file transfer program.

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
Simple Search will scan and search all directories and subdirectories
from a start point (defined by $basedir).  There are 4 different
parameters that can be passed to it:  case, bool, and terms.

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
    case

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
        This parameter defines whether a search will be case-sensitive or
        case-insensitive.  The default is case-insensitive.

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
    bool

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
        If there is more then one term in the search query, this parameter
        defines whether the terms AND'ed or OR'ed.  The default is OR.

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
    terms

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
        This parameter contains the terms that will be searched.

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
    directory

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
        This optional parameter will only be used if $emulate_matts_code
        is set to 0.  It is the zero based index into the configuration
        variable @subdirs which allows you to specify an alternate
        starting subdirectory for your search: this might be useful if
        you have the content on your site arranged in categories by
        directory.  You will probably want to use a drop-down list so
        that users of Simple Search don't need to know the numbers.

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
See the search.html file bundled with the Simple Search distriubtion for
an example of how to fully construct a form to use with simple search.
As an example, a small form can be embedded into a page using a construct
similar to the following:

    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
<![CDATA[
    <form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/search.pl">
        <input type="text" name="terms" size="40" />
        <input type="submit" />
    </form>
]]>

    </paragraph>
  
  </installation>
