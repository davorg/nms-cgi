SUMMARY

nms_sendmail is a Perl script that can be used in place of the
'sendmail' program required by some CGI scripts.  nms_sendmail
is *not* a CGI script itself, it's a supporting utility required
to run CGI scripts such as NMS FormMail on platforms that lack a
suitable sendmail program.

FILES

In this distribution, you will find three files:

nms_sendmail   - The Perl script
README         - This file. Instructions on how to use nms_sendmail
MANIFEST       - List of files

CONFIGURATION

You need to configure either the name or IP address of an SMTP
relay that nms_sendmail can use to send out mail.

Your system administrator or hosting provider should be able
to give you the name or IP address of an SMTP relay that
your web server will be able to use.

Edit nms_sendmail, and find the line near the top where
$mailhost is set:

  my $mailhost = 'localhost';

and change it to something like:

  my $mailhost = 'smtpmail.name-of-your-isp.net';

or:

  my $mailhost = '10.3.45.253';

Depending on the SMTP server software that your chosen SMTP
relay uses, you may also need to set the $helohost
configuration variable to a valid host name.  The name of
the web server is best:

   my $helohost = 'www.my.domain';

INSTALLATION

The nms_sendmail script is installed by simply copying it
into the web server's filesystem.

The best location is somewhere outside the web server's
document root, so that a malicious person attempting to
attack your web server will have no chance of accessing
nms_sendmail directly.

If you're using an account on a shared server and don't
have access to any location outside the document root,
then it's worth asking your hosting provider to install
nms_sendmail outside the document root for you.

The next best place to install nms_sendmail is in a
subdirectory to which your web server is configured to
deny all access.

Failing that, just make sure that you put it somewhere
such that the web server won't treat it as a CGI script.
Never install nms_sendmail in a cgi-bin directory or
rename it to nms_sendmail.pl or nms_sendmail.cgi or
anything like that.

CGI SCRIPT CONFIGURATION

These examples deal with configuring NMS FormMail.pl to
use nms_sendmail, but the other NMS scripts that send
email are configured in a similar way.

On a UNIX-like system with nms_sendmail installed as
/usr/local/bin/nms_sendmail, replace the $mailprog configuration
line in FormMail.pl with the two lines:

  $^X =~ /(.+)/ or die;
  $mailprog = "$1 -wT /usr/local/bin/nms_sendmail -io -t";

On a Windows system with nms_sendmail installed as
c:\nms_utils\nms_sendmail, configure the $mailprog
setting in FormMail.pl with:

  $^X =~ /(.+)/ or die;
  $mailprog = "$1 -wT c:/nms_utils/nms_sendmail -oi -t";

On a Windows system with nms_sendmail installed in a
directory with spaces or punctuation in its name:

  $^X =~ /(.+)/ or die;
  $mailprog = qq|$1 -wT "c:/program files/nms/nms_sendmail" -oi -t|;
