    <h3>Getting involved</h3>

    <p>We always need developers, tech writers and testers to work on making
      <span class="nms">nms</span> better. Please visit the 
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nms-cgi/"><span class="nms">nms</span>
        project page</a> on Sourceforge for more details on getting involved.</p>

    <p>Currently our biggest requirement is for people to get involved with
      the support mailing list. If you'd like to help out answering people's
      questions about our programs then please
      <a href="mailto:davorg@users.sourceforge.net">let us know</a>.</p>

    <p>There are currently two mailing lists set up for the discussion of
      <span class="nms">nms</span>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <span class="nms">nms</span>
        <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/nms-cgi-support">end-user support</a> list</li>
      <li>The <span class="nms">nms</span>
        <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/nms-cgi-devel">developers discussion</a> list</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Future Plans</h3>

    <p>The initial plan is to create a set of scripts that mirror exactly
      the functionality of Matt's scripts (minus the insecurities and 
      bugs). This is now complete. Now I'd like to look at extending the
      archive in four directions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Simplifying and improving the installation process.</li>

      <li>Adding new functionality to the existing scripts.</li>

      <li>Adding new scripts that are not in the original list.</li>

      <li>Adding enhanced versions of the scripts which require slightly
        more knowledge from the person installing them - perhaps needing
        modules from CPAN.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Any suggestions in any of these areas will be appreciated.</p>
