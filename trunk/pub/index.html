    <h1><span class="nms">nms</span></h1>

    <h2>What is <span class="nms">nms</span>?</h2>

    <p><span class="nms">nms</span> is a set of CGI scripts that are intended
      as drop-in replacments for the scripts at 
      <a href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/">Matt's Script
	Archive</a>. Matt's Script Archive has been on the web since 1995. It 
      is a repository of CGI scripts written in Perl by a programmer called 
      Matt Wright.</p>

    <p>MSA is probably the most popular repository of CGI scripts currently
      available on the internet.</p>

    <h2>Why do we need a replacement for Matt's Script Archive?</h2>

    <p>The problem is that Matt is not exactly the world's best Perl 
      programmer. His scripts are well known amongst the community to be
      badly written, buggy and insecure. Anyone asking for support on Matt's
      scripts in any forum will be told in no uncertain terms that they
      shouldn't use his scripts.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately until now there have been no replacements for Matt's
      scripts that you would want people to use. Some months ago, 
      <a href="http://london.pm.org">the London Perl Mongers</a> decided
      to address this problem and write a series of <i>drop-in</i>
      replacements for Matt's scripts. This project is the result.</p>

    <h2>So what exactly is <span class="nms">nms</span>?</h2>

    <p><span class="nms">nms</span> is a project hosted at
      <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. The intention
      is to produce drop-in replacements for all of Matt's scripts. This
      means that someone who uses one of Matt's scripts should be able to
      get the <span class="nms">nms</span> replacement and just drop it in
      in place of the original script. Everything should then work exactly
      as before, except that the user will sleep easier knowing that their
      web site is that little more secure.</p>

    <p>Note that these scripts are intended to replace Matt's scripts. 
      This means that their target audience is people who might not know 
      very much at all about Perl. Any contributed scripts must 
      therefore follow certain rules:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>They must run under Perl 5.004_04 or later. Any earlier Perl
	than this is pre-historic and can therefore be safely ignored.</li>

      <li>They must <b>not</b> use any non-standard Perl modules. I know
	this is a bit contentious, but I really think that the target
	audience will have problems installing modules from CPAN.</li>

      <li>They must run with no errors or warnings under <tt>use strict</tt>
	and <tt>-wT</tt>. One of the worst legacies of Matt's scripts is 
	that people use them to learn Perl. And Matt is a complete 
	stranger to programming under these contraints. If people learn 
	Perl from NMS they will at least learn better programming 
	habits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting involved</h2>

    <p>We always need developers, tech writers and testers to work on making
      <span class="nms">nms</span> better. Please visit the 
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nms-cgi/"><span class="nms">nms</span>
        project page</a> on Sourceforge for more details on getting involved.</p>

    <p>There are currently two mailing lists set up for the discussion of
      <span class="nms">nms</span>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <span class="nms">nms</span>
        <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/nms-cgi-support">end-user support</a> list</li>
      <li>The <span class="nms">nms</span>
        <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/nms-cgi-devel">developers discussion</a> list</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>So what's here?</h2>

    <p>Did I mention this was a work in progress? Here are the scripts that
      are currently available. Others will follow in due course.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Most of the docs included with the scripts are a bit 
      rough and ready and could use some tidying up. If you'd like to 
      help, please get <a href="mailto:davorg@users.sourceforge.net">in touch 
        with me</a>.</p>

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>

    <p>The initial plan is to create a set of scripts that mirror exactly
      the functionality of Matt's scripts (minus the insecurities and 
      bugs). Once this is complete, I'd like to look at extending the
      archive in four directions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Simplifying and improving the installation process.</li>

      <li>Adding new functionality to the existing scripts.</li>

      <li>Adding new scripts that are not in the original list.</li>

      <li>Adding enhance versions of the scripts which require slightly
        more knowledge from the person installing them - perhaps needing
        modules from CPAN.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Any suggestions in any of these areas will be appreciated, but won't
      be acted on until the initial scripts are complete.</p>

    <h2>Why the name <span class="nms">nms</span>?</h2>

    <p><span class="nms">nms</span> originally stood for something that
      was pretty derogatory to Matt Wright and his scripts. Whilst I still
      believe that his scripts should not be used, I decided that the name
      of the project shouldn't be so negative. Unfortunately, by the time
      I'd reached that decision, the name <span class="nms">nms</span>
      had pretty much stuck and I didn't want to change it.</p>

    <p>There was some <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=113073">discussion</a> 
      on <a href="http://perlmonks.org">PerlMonks</a>
      about alternative meanings for <span class="nms">nms</span>, and
      whilst I like many of those ideas, I think that 
      <span class="nms">nms</span> probably doesn't actually stand for 
      anything.</p>
