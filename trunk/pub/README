OK, so here's how the new stuff works.

You'll need to install the Template Toolkit. This can be as simple as

  $ perl -MCPAN -e'install Template'

Now you've got all of the input pages in ./in and a handful of library
templates in ./lib. We'll use this to build the output files (i.e. the
web site) in ./out. To do this we use a program called 'ttree' which
comes with TT. 'ttree' needs a config file to tell it which directories
to use. There's a .ttreerc included in the project. To tell 'ttree' to
use this on instead of one in your home directory (which is its default
action) you need to see the TTREERC variable like this:

  $ export TTREERC=./.ttreerc

This works in a modern bash-like shell. For other things, you're on your
own!

Now, you can rebuild the site from the input templates jsut be typing

  $ ttree

See how it told you what it was doing.

That's really all there is to it right now. Let me know (dave@dave.org.uk)
if you have any questions.

Now I need to thing about how I'm going to get the FAQ pages to fit into
this framework.
