The simple search script was written to allow people to set up a search of 
their site, so their users could enter keywords and find all documents 
matching those keywords.  It was written to be simple, so there are not 
many options.  When the search returns pages, it returns them in no real 
order, and they are referenced with the <title> tag of that page (if one
exists).

The instructions below explain how to set up and configure the Simple Search 
script.  The script should have come with three files:

  1) README      - Useful installation instructions (this file).
  2) search.pl   - The Perl script which does the searching.
  3) search.html - A sample HTML Search Page.

SEARCH.PL
=========

This script is the one that you will need to define what files you want to 
be searched and the locations of those files.  First you need to define the 
variables:

  $basedir = '';
    This is the base directory to the files you will want to search.  If 
    you have all of your files in /home/joe/public_html and you want to 
    search files that are in /home/joe/public_html/work and 
    /home/joe/public_html/fun, then you would set your base directory to 
    /home/joe/public_html/ and then put the subdirectories into the @files 
    array, since they will be combined at run time. The $basedir variable 
    just saves you the time of having to type out the basedir over and over 
    again for every file you want to include.

  $baseurl = '';
    This is very similar to the basedir variable except that it will be used
    as a base reference to the files you want to search in terms of the web.
    For the example above with user joe, his baseurl would probably be 
    something like: http://joe.host.com/~joe/ so that when the searched files
    are appended to this baseurl, they form a complete url to his files to
    place in the results.

  @files = ();
    This is an array that includes all of the files you want to search.  The
    directory paths and filenames should be in reference to $basedir.  Wild
    cards are allowed in this array, so if joe wanted to search all html
    files in fun/ and work/, he would set his @files array up as: @files =
    ('fun/*.html','work/*.html');  You can also search whole directories at
    one time, like: @files = ('fun/','work/');  This would search all files
    located in these directories.  Putting exact filenames will search only
    that filename.

  $title = "";
    This variable is used to display the title of your page in the search
    results and used to link back to your main page.

  $title_url = '';
    This is the url that would link to the page $title.

  $search_url = '';
    This is the url to the search.html page you set up, so that it can be
    referenced from in the results page if users want to make another search.

That is all of the variables that need to be configured in your script. You 
must also chmod this script to 755 so that all users can execute it and place 
it in your cgi-bin or change the name to search.cgi.  Now you simply have to 
edit the search.html page and you are ready to go!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEARCH.HTML
===========

This page needs only a little changing.  You will probably want to change the 
title and header of this page to match your site, and you may want to change 
the background and other features of it to make it fit into your site better.

The main thing you will need to change is the action="" of your script from 
the fake url, to the url of your search.pl script.  Once you have changed 
this, and have implemented the changes listed above in search.pl, the search 
program should work.

search.html should be chmoded 744 so that it is readable by everyone.
