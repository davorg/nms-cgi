  wwwboard.html - The HTML web board file that users will see
  ChangeLog     - The change history of these files

CONFIGURATION and INSTALLATION

There are a number of files to configure in order to get the wwwboard working.
During the following you will be guided through the configuration and installation of all the files and settings in order to have a working wwwboard.

* wwwboard.pl
   Settings

      $DEBUGGING          - This should be set to 1 whilst you are installing
                            and testing the script. Once the script is live you
                            should change it to 0. When set to 1, errors will be
                            output to the browser. This is a security risk and
                            should not be used when the script is live.

      $emulate_matts_code - This determines whether the program should behave
                            exactly like the original wwwboard program
                            from Matt Wright Script Archive.  It should
                            be set to 1 if you want to emulate the
                            original program - this is recommended if
                            you are replacing an existing installation
                            with this program.  If it is set to 0 then
                            potentially it will not work with files
                            produced by the original version - this is
                            recommended for people installing this for
                            the first time. It is also more secure to set
                            it to 0 as the original script had many flaws
                            which don't show up when not using emulation.

      $max_followups      - In the original wwwboard it would be possible
                            for a person with minimal skill to construct
                            a request that could create a followup to
                            every existing message on the board which
                            could cause wwwboard.html to become extremely
                            large and potentially effect a Denial of Service
                            on your site.  By setting this variable to a
                            reasonably low number you will be able to
                            reduce the impact of an attack of this sort.
                            If it is set to zero then any depth of followups
                            will be allowed.  This setting only takes effect
                            if $emulate_matts_code is set to 0.

      $basedir            - This is the directory from / on the server's
                            filesystem. It is not the directory that
                            appears in the web address, although part of
                            it may be. Neither is it the cgi-bin directory
                            where you put the wwwboard.pl file. This is
                            where you upload the wwwboard by ftp. If you
                            are not running your own server and aren't
                            sure what this value should be, contact your
                            system administrator to make sure you have
                            the right value.

      $baseurl            - This is the full website address (URL) to the
                            directory containing the wwwboard files. This
                            this the directory that'll contain messages/,
                            data.txt, wwwboard.html and faq.html. It's
                            the web equivalent of $basedir.

      $cgi_url            - This is the full website address (URL) to the
                            wwwboard.pl file which will run the wwwboard.

      $mesgdir            - This is the directory, in $basedir, where the
                            wwwboard messages will be stored.

      $datafile           - This is the name of the file, in $basedir, where
                            important information for the wwwboard to function
                            will be stored.

      $mesgfile           - This is the name of the HTML file, in $basedir,
                            which will make your wwwboard.

      $faqfile            - This is the name of the Frequently Asked Question
                            (FAQ) file, in $basedir, which will be used to
                            answer wwwboard users' questions.

      $ext                - This is the extension that will be given to
                            various web documents created by wwwboard. You
                            should leave it as 'html' for most purposes,
                            although you might want to change it to
                            'htm' if using MS-DOS.

      $title              - This is the title that will be displayed on the
                            program generated pages.

      $style              - This is the web address (URL) of a CSS stylesheet
                            which will be used for script generated
                            messages.  This probably wants to be the
                            same as the one that you use for all the
                            other pages.  This should be a local absolute
                            URI fragment such as '/css/style.css/'.

      $show_faq           - If $show_faq is set to 1 then the link for the
                            wwwboard FAQ will be shown on the generated pages.

      $allow_html         - If $allow_html is set to 1 then HTML will not be
                            removed from the body of the message.  Scripting
                            and other potentially malicious constructs will
                            still be removed, and closing tags will be added
                            for any tags left open in the message.

      $quote_text         - If $quote_text is set to 1 then the text of the
                            original message will be placed in the
                            "Post Followup" text box.

      $quote_char         - This is the string that will be prepended to each
                            quoted line if $quote_text described above is set
                            to 1.

      $quote_html         - If $quote_html is set to 1 then if $quote_text is
                            set to 1 above the original HTML in the
                            post will be retained in the followup -
                            otherwise it will be removed.

      $subject_line       - When set to 0, the subject will be quoted and
                            editable. When set to 1, the subject will
                            be quoted but uneditable. When set to 2,
                            the subject will not be quoted but will
                            be editable.

      $use_time           - If $use_time is set to 1 then the dates will be
                            displayed as "$time_fmt $date_fmt" - see note below
                            about date formats.

      $date_fmt
      $time_fmt           - $date_fmt and $time_fmt describe the format of the
                            dates that will output - the replacement parameters
                            you can use here are

            %A - the full name of the weekday according to the current locale
            %B - the full name of the month according to the current locale
            %m - the month as a number
            %d - the day of the month as a number
            %D - the date in the form %m/%d/%y (i.e. the US format )
            %y - the year as a number without the century
            %Y - the year as a number including the century
            %H - the hour as number in the 24 hour clock
            %M - the minute as a number
            %S - the seconds as a number
            %T - the time in 24 hour format (%H:%M:%S)
            %Z - the time zone (full name or abbreviation)

                             If you are going to be running this program
                             on Apple OSX then you should avoid %Z as there
                             is a problem with getting the correct timezome
                             on that OS.

      $show_poster_ip     - Set to 1, the client IP address of the poster is
                            displayed in the message. Otherwise it won't.

      $extra_strict       - Set to 1 to strip suspicious content that may be
                            used to spike the forum with unwanted messages.
                            CAUTION: This may be over-zealous and remove content
                            that you may consider useful. Test before using.

      $enable_preview     - Set this to 1 to add a preview button to all script
                            generated forms, to allow users to preview their
                            messages before posting.

      $enforce_max_len    - Set to 2, this will force the max length settings
                            listed below by giving an error. Set to 1,
                            this will force by truncating too long
                            text. Set to 0, it will ignore the max
                            length settings.

      %max_len            - Contains the maximum lengths of the data allowed in
                            the various fields - they must be supplied if
                            $enforce_max_len is not 0.

      $strict_image       - If set to 1 will require that an image url if
                            supplied must end in one of the common suffixes as
                            defined in @image_suffixes.

      $image_suffixes     - This is a list of the extensions that the image URL
                            must end with if $strict_image above is set to 1 -
                            this is to minimize a potential for the entry of
                            entry of a malicious URL that may be used to attack
                            another host or disfigure this web page.

      $charset            - The character set to use for output documents.


      $bannedwords        - This can be the full path to a text file containing
                            complete or partial words (or perl regular
                            expressions) , one per line, that must not
                            appear in the post. If a match is found then
                            the post will not made.

      $bannednets         - This can be the full path to a text file containing
                            either single IP addresses or network
                            specifications in CIDR notation, one per line,
                            against which the client's address is checked.
                            If a match is found an error message will
                            displayed and the post will not be allowed.
                            CIDR notation is a way of specifying a whole
                            network by giving the network (start) address
                            followed by a slash and then the number of
                            bits in the sub-net mask which indicates
                            how many IPs are in the network.  For example:

                              192.168.1.0/24 is 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255
                              10.0.0.0/8     is 10.0.0.0 -   10.255.255.255
                            
                            (These examples are not really useable as the
                            first refers to a private network you will not
                            see on the public internet and the second would
                            block about a quarter of the internet :)
                            (For the curious the number of IPs is derived from
                             the CIDR number by the formula:
   
                                 2^(32 -$cidr)
                           
                             where $cidr is the number after the slash.)
                            You probably will have determined the IPs or
                            networks to block from IPs of abusive posters.
                            This should be used carefully as it is possible
                            that you may block innocent posters where a
                            large number of internet users use a single
                            IP address (like AOL users) or where an addresses
                            may get used by different people (as with dialup
                            accounts for instance.)

      @use_rbls           - This is a list of DNSBL zones that list open 
                            proxies or exploited computers that can be
                            used by spammers or crackers to attempt to
                            anonymously access wwwboard, if this is
                            set and the requesting client appears in
                            one of the lists then the request will be
                            refused before any further action is taken
                            Care should be taken in using this item as
                            a lookup on a nonexistent or overloaded zone
                            could block for some time.  More information
                            on DNSBL and useful zones can be found in
                            README.dnsbl you got with wwwboard.

      $check_sc_uri       - *THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL* - if this is set to 1
                            then a check will be made against all the inputs
                            from the form for anything that looks like a URL
                            and then the domains found in these URLs will be
                            checked against the DNSBL sc.surbl.org which
                            holds domains that have been found in SPAM. This
                            is experimental and not widely tested - the 
                            developers would be interested in getting
                            feedback.
   

   Installation
      You must upload this file to your server's cgi-bin or in a directory where
      CGI execution is allowed. Make sure the directory and path match the
      $cgi_url put in the settings. You must also give the file the right
      permissions. In order to do so, the file must be chmoded to 755 using the
      following command
         chmod 755 wwwboard.pl

* wwwboard.html
   Settings
      <form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/wwwboard.pl">
                          - This is the only setting to modify in this file. The
                            only thing you got to make sure of is the action=""
                            path which has to be the same as the $cgi_url. No
                            need to put the http://www.yourpage.com, but it
                            won't hurt if you do.

      Other               - Please feel free to change the <title>, headers and
                            layout of this page. The only things that need to
                            remain intact are the <form>, <input> and
                            <textarea> tags.

   Installation
      This is fairly simple. Just put it in your $basedir so that people
      visiting $baseurl/wwwboard.html will see it. You also have to chmod the
      file to 777 using the following command
         chmod 777 wwwboard.html

* faq.html
   Settings

      you want in it. Just make sure that the links to wwwboard.html work.

   Installation
      This is fairly simple. Just put it in your $basedir so that people
      visiting $baseurl/wwwboard.html will see it. Normally, you should not need
      to chmod it. However, it should be chmoded to 644.

* Administration files (wwwadmin.pl, passwd.txt, ADMIN_README)
   If your site attracts unwanted attention, close monitoring of the
   wwwadmin.pl output is essential. If you let spurious, malicious,
   illegal, commercial or unwanted posts linger on your board for days,
   you only encourage similar activity.  However, the administrative files
   are not necessary to run the boards. That is, if you do not wish to
   set them up or use them, you can still have a working wwwboard. They
   are simply a useful tool for the wwwboard administrator to delete
   messages and perform other administrative tasks. Their settings and
   installation procedure is discussed in ADMIN_README.
