SUMMARY

wwwboard is a script which allows you to create and maintain a discussion
forum on the web. On the forum, people will be able to post and reply to
posts.

FILES

In this distribution, you will find these files
  README        - Configuration and installation instructions. This file
  wwwboard.pl   - Script containing the config and making everything work
  wwwboard.html - The HTML web board file that users will see
  faq.html      - A FAQ file for users of wwwboard
  data.txt      - Where the file number is stored
  messages/     - Where the discussion messages will be created and stored
  wwwadmin.pl   - An administration tool to delete messages
  passwd.txt    - The encoded password and username for wwwadmin
  ADMIN_README  - wwwadmin config and install instruction.

CONFIGURATION and INSTALLATION

There are a number of files to configure in order to get the wwwboard working.
During the following you will be guided through the configuration and installation of all the files and settings in order to have a working wwwboard.

* wwwboard.pl
   Settings

      $DEBUGGING          - This should be set to 1 whilst you are installing
                            and testing the script. Once the script is live you
                            should change it to 0. When set to 1, errors will be
                            output to the browser. This is a security risk and
                            should not be used when the script is live.

      $emulate_matts_code - This determines whether the program should behave
                            exactly like the original wwwboard program
                            from Matt Wright Script Archive.  It should
                            be set to 1 if you want to emulate the
                            original program - this is recommended if
                            you are replacing an existing installation
                            with this program.  If it is set to 0 then
                            potentially it will not work with files
                            produced by the original version - this is
                            recommended for people installing this for
                            the first time. It is also more secure to set
                            it to 0 as the original script had many flaws
                            which don't show up when not using emulation.

      $max_followups      - In the original wwwboard it would be possible
                            for a person with minimal skill to construct
                            a request that could create a followup to
                            every existing message on the board which
                            could cause wwwboard.html to become extremely
                            large and potentially effect a Denial of Service
                            on your site.  By setting this variable to a
                            reasonably low number you will be able to
                            reduce the impact of an attack of this sort.
                            If it is set to zero then any depth of followups
                            will be allowed.  This setting only takes effect
                            if $emulate_matts_code is set to 0.

      $basedir            - This is the directory from / on the server's
                            filesystem. It is not the directory that
                            appears in the web address, although part of
                            it may be. Neither is it the cgi-bin directory
                            where you put the wwwboard.pl file. This is
                            where you upload the wwwboard by ftp. If you
                            are not running your own server and aren't
                            sure what this value should be, contact your
                            system administrator to make sure you have
                            the right value.

      $baseurl            - This is the full website address (URL) to the
                            directory containing the wwwboard files. This
                            this the directory that'll contain messages/,
                            data.txt, wwwboard.html and faq.html. It's
                            the web equivalent of $basedir.

      $cgi_url            - This is the full website address (URL) to the
                            wwwboard.pl file which will run the wwwboard.

      $mesdir             - This is the directory, in $basedir, where the
                            wwwboard messages will be stored.

      $datafile           - This is the name of the file, in $basedir, where
                            important information for the wwwboard to function
                            will be stored.

      $mesgfile           - This is the name of the HTML file, in $basedir,
                            which will make your wwwboard.

      $faqfile            - This is the name of the Frequently Asked Question
                            (FAQ) file, in $basedir, which will be used to
                            answer wwwboard users' questions.

      $ext                - This is the extension that will be given to 
                            various web documents created by wwwboard. You
                            should leave it as 'html' for most purposes,
                            although you might want to change it to
                            'htm' if using MS-DOS.

      $title              - This is the title that will be displayed on the
                            program generated pages.

      $style              - This is the web address (URL) of a CSS stylesheet
                            which will be used for script generated
                            messages.  This probably want's to be the
                            same as the one that you use for all the
                            other pages.  This should be a local absolute
                            URI fragment.

      $show_faq           - If $show_faq is set to 1 then the link for the
                            wwwboard FAQ will be shown on the generated pages.

      $allow_html         - If $allow_html is set to 1 then HTML will not be
                            removed from the body of the message.
                            Be warned however that setting this is a
                            possible security risk allowing malicious
                            defacement of the page and possible cross
                            page scripting attacks on this or other site.

      $quote_text         - If $quote_text is set to 1 then the text of the
                            original message will be placed in the
                            "Post Followup" text box.

      $quote_char         - This is the string that will be prepended to each
                            quoted line if $quote_text described above is set
                            to 1.

      $quote_html         - If $quote_html is set to 1 then if $quote_text is
                            set to 1 above the original HTML in the
                            post will be retained in the followup -
                            otherwise it will be removed.

      $subject_line       - When set to 0, the subject will be quoted and
                            editable. When set to 1, the subject will
                            be quoted but uneditable. When set to 2,
                            the subject will not be quoted but will
                            be editable.

      $use_time           - If $use_time is set to 1 then the dates will be
                            displayed as "$time_fmt $date_fmt" - see note below
                            about date formats.

      $date_fmt
      $time_fmt           - $date_fmt and $time_fmt describe the format of the
                            dates that will output - the replacement parameters
                            you can use here are

            %A - the full name of the weekday according to the current locale
            %B - the full name of the month according to the current locale
            %m - the month as a number
            %d - the day of the month as a number
            %D - the date in the form %m/%d/%y (i.e. the US format )
            %y - the year as a number without the century
            %Y - the year as a number including the century
            %H - the hour as number in the 24 hour clock
            %M - the minute as a number
            %S - the seconds as a number
            %T - the time in 24 hour format (%H:%M:%S)
            %Z - the time zone (full name or abbreviation)

                             If you are going to be running this program
                             on Apple OSX then you should avoid %Z as there
                             is a problem with getting the correct timezome
                             on that OS.

      $show_poster_ip     - Set to 1, the client IP address of the poster is
                            displayed in the message. Otherwise it won't.

      $enforce_max_len    - Set to 2, this will force the max length settings
                            listed below by giving an error. Set to 1,
                            this will force by truncating too long
                            text. Set to 0, it will ignore the max
                            length settings.

      %max_len            - Contains the maximum lengths of the data allowed in
                            the various fields - they must be supplied if
                            $enforce_max_len is not 0.

      $strict_image       - If set to 1 will require that an image url if
                            supplied must end in one of the common suffixes as
                            defined in @image_suffixes.

      $image_suffixes     - This is a list of the extensions that the image URL
                            must end with if $strict_image above is set to 1 -
                            this is to minimize a potential for the entry of
                            entry of a malicious URL that may be used to attack
                            another host or disfigure this web page.

   Installation
      You must upload this file to your server's cgi-bin or in a directory where
      CGI execution is allowed. Make sure the directory and path match the
      $cgi_url put in the settings. You must also give the file the right
      permissions. In order to do so, the file must be chmoded to 755 using the
      following command
         chmod 755 wwwboard.pl

* wwwboard.html
   Settings
      <form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/wwwboard.pl">
                          - This is the only setting to modify in this file. The
                            only thing you got to make sure of is the action=""
                            path which has to be the same as the $cgi_url. No
                            need to put the http://www.yourpage.com, but it
                            won't hurt if you do.

      Other               - Please feel free to change the <title>, headers and
                            layout of this page. The only things that need to
                            remain intact are the <form>, <input> and
                            <textarea> tags.

   Installation
      This is fairly simple. Just put it in your $basedir so that people
      visiting $baseurl/wwwboard.html will see it. You also have to chmod the
      file to 777 using the following command
         chmod 777 wwwboard.html

* faq.html
   Settings
      This file does not need to be edited. However feel free to change anything
      you want in it. Just make sure that the links to wwwboard.html work.

   Installation
      This is fairly simple. Just put it in your $basedir so that people
      visiting $baseurl/wwwboard.html will see it. Normally, you should not need
      to chmod it. However, it should be chmoded to 644.

* messages/
   Settings
      None.

   Installation
      This is fairly simple. Just put it in your $basedir. You also have to
      chmod the directory to 777 using the following command
         chmod 777 messages/

* data.txt
   Settings
      None.

   Installation
      Simply upload this file to $basedir, as mentionned in wwwboard.pl. You
      also have to chmod the file to 666 (no, we are not the devil) using the
      following command
         chmod 666 data.txt

* Administration files (wwwadmin.pl, passwd.txt, ADMIN_README)
   The administrative files are not necessary to run the boards. That is, if you
   do not wish to set them up or use them, you can still have a working
   wwwboard. They are simply a useful tool for the wwwboard administrator to
   delete messages and perform other administrative tasks. Their settings and
   installation procedure is discussed in ADMIN_README.
