SUMMARY

The Guestbook is a program that allows visitors to your website to leave
a message on the Guestbook page.

FILES

In this distribution you will find five files:

README               - This file. Instructions on how to install and use 
                       guestbook.
guestbook.pl         - The main Perl program file.
guestbook-admin.pl   - A program to perform adminstrative tasks on the
                       guestbook.
guestbook.html       - The file in which the guestbook entries are saved.
addguest.html        - The form that visitors will use for a guestbook entry.
guestlog.html        - A log file of those who have added entries to guestbook.


CONFIGURATION

In order for this program to work properly on your webserver it will require
a small amount of configuration before you upload it.

All of the configuration is done by editing the program file directly, you
can do this in your favourite text editor or notepad if you are on Windows.
You probably don't want to use a wordprocessor to do this unless you are
certain you can save the file as plain text.

Firstly you may need to change the first line of the program:

   #!/usr/bin/perl -wT

so that it points at the proper location of perl on your webserver - your
system administrator or webhosting provider should be able to tell you this.
You only need to change the '/usr/bin/perl' part - all of the rest of the
line must be left exactly as it is. If your site is hosted on a Windows
server then you probably shouldn't change it at all but you should read the
FAQ at http://nms-cgi.sf.net/faq_prob.html if you have an error like
'Too late for "-T"'.

There are a number of variables that you should change in guestbook.pl which
alter the way that the program works.

If you are unsure of the appropriate value for variables that relate to the
setup of your webserver you should ask your system administrator or
web hosting provider.

$DEBUGGING     - This should be set to 1 whilst you are installing
                 and testing the script. If you are reporting a problem to
                 the NMS team then they will be able to give you better
                 help if you can give the message when this is set to 1.
                 Once the script is live and working you should change
                 it to 0. When set to 1, errors will be output to the
                 browser. This is a potential security risk and should
                 not be used when the script is live.

$guestbookurl  - The public URL of your guestbook.html file.

$guestbookreal - The filesystem location of your guestbook.html file on the
                 webserver.

$guestlog      - The filesystem location of your guestlog.html file on the
                 webserver.

$cgiurl        - The public URL of the guestbook.pl file.

$style         - The URL of a CSS stylesheet that will be used for the
                 HTML that is generated by the program.

$mail          - If this is set to 1 then you will be notified by e-mail
                 of any new entries.  If it is set then the next two
                 variables must be set correctly.  If you don't want to
                 receive e-mail then set this to 0.

$recipient     - The e-mail address of the person who wants to receive
                 notification of new guestbook entries.

$mailprog      - The system command that the script should invoke to
                 send an outgoing email. This should be the full path
                 to a program that will read a message from STDIN and
                 determine the list of message recipients from the
                 message headers. Any switches that the program
                 requires should be provided here.

                 A $mailprog setting that works for many UNIX-like
                 hosts is:

                   $mailprog = '/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -t -oem';

                 Some other UNIX-like hosts need:

                   $mailprog = '/usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t -oem';

                 If your web server lacks a sendmail binary, you can
                 use an SMTP relay instead, by setting $mailprog like
                 this:

                   $mailprog = 'SMTP:mailhost.your.domain';

                 You will need to replace mailhost.your.domain with
                 the name or IP address of an SMTP server configured
                 to relay mail for the web server.

                 Your system administrator or hosting provider should
                 be able to tell you either the path to sendmail on the
                 web server or the name of a host that will act as an
                 SMTP relay for the web server.

$postmaster    - The envelope sender address to use for all emails
                 sent by the script.  This address will recieve bounce
                 messages if any of the emails cannot be delivered.  If
                 in doubt, put your own email address here.

$uselog        - If this variable is set to 1 then all new entries to the
                 guestbook will be recorded in a short log, also any
                 errors will be recorded.  This log may help you to identify
                 people who are abusing your guestbook as it contains the
                 internet address that oriniated the entries.
                 If you don't want this facility then set this to 0.

$linkmail      - If this is set to 1 then the e-mail addresses that
                 visitors enter will be added as mailto: links rather than
                 just as plain text.  You may not want to do this if you
                 are concerned that spammers might harvest the addresses.

$linkname      - If this is set to 1 then the home page URL that visitors
                 enter will be used to make the "name" field into a link.

$separator     - This determines how the entries in the guestbook page are
                 separated.  If it is set to 1 then the entries will be
                 separated by a horizontal rule (<hr />).  If it is set
                 to 0 then they will be placed in separate paragraphs.

$redirection   - If this variable is set to 1 then the program will issue
                 a browser redirection to the guestbook page after the entry
                 has been added. If it is set to 0 then the visitor will be
                 presented with a page with a link to the modified guestbook
                 page.

$entry_order   - If this is set to 1 then new entries will be added to the
                 top of the guestbook page, if it is set to 0 they will be
                 added at the end. 

$remote_mail   - When this is set to 1 then the visitor who makes the
                 guestbook entry will be sent a confirmation e-mail
                 ( assuming they have entered a valid address ) - you
                 will need to have set $mailprog and $recipient as described
                 above.  You should think carefully about setting this
                 variable as it would be simple for someone to turn your
                 guestbook into an anonymous mail-bomb if they were to
                 enter someone elses e-mail address and repeatedly submit
                 the form.

$allow_html    - If this is set to 0 then all HTML will be stripped from
                 the visitor comments before being added to the guestbook
                 page.  If it is set to 1 then a relatively safe set of
                 HTML elements will be allowed in the input - please see
                 the code in guestbook.pl to find which tags are allowed.
                 Previous versions of this program allowed a user to enter
                 any HTML they wanted which allowed the possibility of
                 third party scripting attacks or defacement of the page.

$line_breaks  -  When set to 1 all of the carriage returns in the visitors
                 comments will be changed to <br /> - this is probably not
                 necessary if $allow_html is set to 1.


$long_date_fmt 
$short_date_fmt - These describe the format of the dates that guestbook
                  will output, $long_date_fmt is used in the guestbook page
                  itself and $short_date_fmt is used in the log file (if you
                  are using it.)  The provided defaults are probably alright
                  for most uses but can be changed to suit your needs. They
                  use codes to represent different parts of the date and time
                  but you can also put your own literal text in (anything that
                  doesn't start with a '%'). Some of these codes will use the
                  setting of $locale (described below) to display in the proper
                  language and/or style.  The replacement parameters you 
                  can use here include:
				
				         %A - the full name of the weekday according to the 
                          current locale
				         %B - the full name of the month according to the 
                          current local
				         %m - the month as a number
				         %d - the day of the month as a number
				         %D - the date in the form %m/%d/%y (i.e. the US format )
				         %y - the year as a number without the century
				         %Y - the year as a number including the century
				         %H - the hour as number in the 24 hour clock
				         %M - the minute as a number
				         %S - the seconds as a number
				         %T - the time in 24 hour format (%H:%M:%S)
				         %Z - the time zone (full name or abbreviation)


$timezone     -   If set this will over-ride the timezone as set on the
                  server.  The timezone is a three upper case letter code
                  with an optional offset from UTC (The time in London) and
                  a code for daylight saving time.  Some examples might be:

                       EST5EDT   America/New_York
                       MST7MDT   America/Denver
                       PST8PDT   America/Los_Angeles
                       YST9YDT   America/Anchorage
                       CET       European Central Time
                       ROC       Asia/Taipei
                       ROK       Asia/Seoul
                       NZ        Pacific/Auckland
                       MET       Europe/Paris

$locale     -  If this is set it should be set to a valid locale setting
               for your system. This will affect primarily the language
               that is used for displaying the names of days and months
               in the guestbook page. Some example settings are:

                            Catalan           ca_ES
                            Croatian          hr_HR
                            Czech             cs_CZ
                            Danish            da_DK
                            Dutc              nl_NL
                            Estonian          et_EE
                            Finnish           fi_FI
                            French            fr_FR
                            Galician          gl_ES
                            German            de_DE
                            Greek             el_GR

                            Japanese          ja_JP
                            Korean            ko_KR
                            Lithuanian        lt_LT
                            Norwegian         no_NO
                            Polish            pl_PL
                            Portuguese        pt_PT
                            Romanian          ro_RO
                            Russian           ru_RU
                            Slovak            sk_SK
                            Slovenian         sl_SI
                            Spanish           es_ES
                            Swedish           sv_SE
                            Thai              th_TH
                            Turkish           tr_TR

                  of course this is not complete and the proper display
                  of some of the characters may depend on the browser
                  settings. You may want to ask your ISP about the 
                  correct setting.

$hide_new_entries - If this is set to 1 then any new entries on the guestbook
                    will be commented out and not visible in the 
                    guestbook page.  These entries can be 'unhidden' using the
                    guestbook-admin.pl program you should have got as part
                    of this package.  If this is set you probably want to
                    amend your addguest page to indicate that the comments
                    might not show up at once (otherwise you may get
                    frustrated visitors adding multiple entries thinking that
                    their submission hasn't worked). 


You will need also to edit the addguest.html file so that the line :

   <form method="post" action="http://your.host.com/cgi-bin/guestbook.pl">

has the action attribute pointing to the URL of your guestbook program.

You might also want to edit this and the guestbook.html so that it matches
the appearance of your website - being careful that you don't remove the
'<!--begin-->' comment that the program uses to know where to enter the
new entries.

INSTALLATION

All that is need to install the Guestbook is to copy the guestbook.pl file
to the cgi-bin directory (or whatever is appropriate for your system - you
should ask your system administrator or web hosting provider about this if
you are unsure ) on your web server and to copy the addguest.html,
guestbook.html and guestlog.html to the location that you will have entered
in the configuration above.

On some systems you may need to rename guestbook.pl to guestbook.cgi
(or some other extension that the web server uses to indicate a CGI
program.) Again, your system administrator will know if this is the case.

You may need to turn on execute permissions to the file (Windows servers,
for example, do not need this as they will use the location of the program and
the extension to determine how the program is to be run.)  You can
do this by running the command "chmod +x guestbook.pl" from your command
line. If you don't have command line access to your web server then there
will probably be an equivalent function in your file transfer program.

ADMINISTRATION

The guestbook-admin.pl program that you received with the guestbook 
provides some basic facilities for administering your guestbook: you can
hide (and un-hide) entries and delete them. The program should be installed
in the same way as the main guestbook.pl except there are fewer configuration
variables to change.  Those with the same name are described above the others
are:

$password      -  This is the password for the administration page, you 
                  must change this to something only you know before you
                  use the program, if you do not change it the program
                  will not work.  You should choose a password that is
                  difficult to guess, longer than eight characters and
                  probably containing both alphabetic, numeric and
                  punctuation characters. The program cannot enforce
                  an unguessable password (the programs that do this
                  are likely to be several times larger than this one
                  and far more difficult to install,) so it is your
                  responsibility to choose a good one.

$session_dir   -  This is a directory that the program will use to record
                  logins to the administration page, it should be writeable
                  by the user that the web server runs CGI programs as, and
                  should *not* be readable via a browser, the directory
                  must exist as well - a sub-directory of /tmp (on a Unix
                  like system) or C:\temp (on windows) would be ideal but
                  you may not have access to those, you may be able to use
                  a sub-directory of that in which you have your CGI programs
                  but if you are in doubt please consult your ISP.  You
                  probably don't want to use the same directory for 
                  different installations of the admin program.

$myURL         -  This should be the URL for the guestbook-admin.pl as it
                  appears on your website.  It is probably not a good idea
                  to provide a link to this from any other pages on the
                  website however.
