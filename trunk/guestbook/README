There are five files included in the Guestbook package.  Below is a brief 
summary of them:
        1) README - This file.
        2) guestbook.pl - The Perl Script.
        3) guestbook.html - The actual guestbook file.
        4) addguest.html - The fill-out form for a guestbook entry.
        5) guestlog.html - A short log of those who have added.

Below is a more detailed explanation of each file and what to do with it!
____________________

GUESTBOOK.PL - This is the Perl script that actually writes new entries to 
files and returns the entry to the user.  This file will need to be placed
in the cgi-bin of your server and chmoded to a+rx.  There are a few things 
that need to be changed in this file:

   # Set Variables
   $guestbookurl - The url address of your guestbook.html file
   $guestbookreal - The system location of your guestbook.html file
   $guestlog - The system location of your guestlog.html file
   $cgiurl - The url portion of the address to the guestbook.pl file

The file guestbook.pl needs to be placed in your server's cgi-bin and 
chmoded read/execute for users of your httpd. (chmod a+rx)

There are several options that you have to decide whether
or not to use.  Below is a brief description of what each one does.  
While choosing what options you want to have on keep in mind that a '1' 
will turn them on and a '0' will turn them off.

Option 1:  $mail - This option will allow you to be notified via 
an E-Mail address when a new entry arrives in your guestbook.  
The entry will be mailed to you as a notification.  If you should 
choose to turn this variable on you will need to fill in the 2 
variables that go along with it:

   $recipient - Your E-Mail address, so that the mailing 
                program will know who to mail the entry to.
   $mailprog -  The location of your sendmail program on your 
                host machine.

Option 2:  $uselog - This will allow you the ability to use my 
short log feature.  It is already turned on so you will have to 
change it to 0 if you do not wish to use it. I have implemented 
this feature, since there are probably many people who feel no need
to have a log when people are making entries to a file anyway.  
Keep in mind it will show errors which is one nice aspect about it.

Option 3:  $linkmail - Turning this option on will make the 
address links in your guestbook become hyperlinked.  So instead of
simply having (name@some.host) it will put 
(<a href="mailto:name@some.host">name@some.host</a>) so that anyone 
can simply click on the address to email them.

Option 4:  $separator - While looking at many other guestbooks 
I noticed that many people prefer to separate entries with 
a Horizontal Rule <hr> instead of a Paragraph Separator <p>, which 
I used in my old scripts.  I have now given you the option to 
choose.  By changing the 0 in the script to a 1 you will turn on 
the <hr> separator and turn off the <p> separator.  The 0 option 
will do the reverse of that; turn on <p> and turn off <hr>.

Option 5: $redirection - Although Netscape and other browsers handle 
the auto-redirection that I have implemented quite nicely, I have
noticed that it does not work with lynx (a text based browser). 
I have given you the option of using auto-redirection or not.  
Lynx can still add to your guestbook with it, they will just get an 
error message when they do.  This may not be true for all systems 
though.  It seemed that when we upgraded to httpd 1.4 this problem 
started occurring.  By choosing 1 you will enable auto redirection 
and 0 will return a page to the user telling them their entry has 
been received and click here to get back to the guestbook.

Option 6: $entry_order - When this script was first written, entries 
were always added next to the top, so you and other users did not
have to always see the same guestbook entry when they visited your
pages.  The rest of the enties scrolled beneath the newest, from
newest to oldest.  I have had requests that I make an option
available so that people can have a guestbook which would read
from oldest to newest.  This is how you would go about doing that.
Set this option to '0' and the newest entries will be added below
the rest of the entries.  Keep this option at '1' and the guestbook
will act like previous versions, adding the newest entry to the top.

Option 7: $remote_mail - Many users of the guestbook have requested 
that a form letter be automatically sent to the remote user when
they fill in the guestbook.  Turning this option on will tell the
script to automatically mail any user who leaves an email address.
You can specify the contents of the mail mesage by editing the
section of the script that sends mail to the remote user.  By 
default it sends a message that says, "Thank you for adding to my 
guestbook." and then shows them their entry.  If you should
choose to turn this variable on you will need to fill in the 2
variables that go along with it:

    $recipient - Your E-Mail address, so that the mailing
                 program will know who to mail the entry to.
    $mailprog -  The location of your sendmail program on your
                 host machine.

CAUTION: with this option turned on it's possible for someone
to put someone else's email address in the form and submit it
5000 times, causing this script to send a flood of email to a
third party.  This third party is likely to blame you for the
email flood attack.

Option 8: $allow_html = "";
This option allows you to turn on or off the use of HTML tags by 
users of your guestbook.  Setting this variable to '1' allows 
users to imbed html tags such as <b> or <H1> or <a href=""></a> 
into your html document.  Setting this variable to '0' will not 
allow them to use any html syntax in their comments or any other 
field.  You can still link to their email address by turning 
$link_mail to '1'.

Option 9: $line_breaks - This option allows you to decide whether 
or not you want line breaks in the comment field to be turned into 
<br>'s in the html thing to retain the look of the guestbook entry.  
Common setting would be off, because sometimes people accidentally 
put in extra line breaks.

____________________


GUESTBOOK.HTML - This is the file that you will link to that will contain the 
Guestbook Entries.  You will need to have this set at write/read permission 
for the users (chmod a+rw).  You will probably need to edit the url for the 
link to the addguest.html file and edit the url at the end of this page to 
point back to your home page.  You will also want to edit the title and 
heading spaces.  Do not delete the line <!--begin--> from this 
guestbook, or else the script will have no way of knowing where to begin the 
editing.  The <!--begin--> line is the only necessary line in your 
guestbook.html file, but the link to the addguest.html file is also a good 
idea.  :)
____________________

ADDGUEST.HTML - This is a fill-out form to add a new entry into the 
guestbook.  You will need to edit parts of it to correct urls and 
names of things, but leave the basic field names in place in the form.  You 
will also need to change the action of the form to point to the guestbook.pl 
file you placed in your cgi-bin.  The action of the form should be the same 
as the $cgiurl variable you configured in your guestbook.pl file.
____________________

GUESTLOG.HTML - This is a short log that lists domains and times that entries 
were created.  Much easier to browse and it will point out those failed entries 
when users did not specify a name or comments.  This file will also need 
read/write permission given to it.  To avoid long scripting (call me lazy if 
you want :-) ) I left the log file so that newest entries are added at the 
bottom.  This should be apparent though since the entries all come with a 
short date added.  You can get around using this by changing the option 
$uselog in the guestbook.pl file.
