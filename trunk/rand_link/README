SUMMARY

rand_link chooses a random link from a set of predefined links and
displays it on a webpage.

FILES

In this distribution, you will find three files:

rand_link.pl   - The main perl script.
README         - This file. Instructions on how to install and use rand_link.
MANIFESTO      - List of files.
rand_link.html - A sample HTML file.

CONFIGURATION

There are a number of variables that you can change in rand_link.pl which
alter the way that the program works.

$DEBUGGING    - This should be set to 1 whilst you are installing
                and testing the script. Once the script is live you
                should change it to 0. When set to 1, errors will
                be output to the browser. This is a security risk and
                should not be used when the script is live.

$linkfile     - The path to the file where you store your links.Links
                are stored in this file, one per line. Only the URL of
                the link should be stored.

$uselog       - Set this value to 1 to log which link is returned each time
                the program runs.

$logfile      - The path to the logfile, only needed if $uselog = 1. This file
                must be writable by the webserver. For example,

                    $logfile = "/tmp/randlinks.log";


INSTALLATION

rand_link is installed simply by copying the file rand_link.pl.pl into your
cgi-bin directory. If you don't know where your cgi-bin directory is, then
please ask your system administrator

You may need to rename rand_link.pl to rand_link.cgi. Again, your system
administrator will know if this is the case.

You will probably need to turn on execute permissions to the file. You can
do this by running the command "chmod +x rand_link.pl" from your command
line. If you don't have command line access to your web server then there
will probably be an equivalent function in your file transfer program.

Then, edit your HTML files and change all the links that you want to
be randomized to:

<a href="http://your.host.com/cgi-bin/rand_link.pl">A mystery tour</a>

This is just an example, so be sure to insert the correct URL of your
rand_link.pl installation.
