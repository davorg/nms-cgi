There are a number of variables that you can change in rand_link.pl which
alter the way that the program works.

            This should be set to 1 whilst you are installing
                and testing the script. Once the script is live you
                should change it to 0. When set to 1, errors will
                be output to the browser. This is a security risk and
                should not be used when the script is live.

            The path to the file where you store your links.Links
                are stored in this file, one per line. Only the URL of
                the link should be stored.

  <installation>
      <paragraph>
rand_link is installed simply by copying the file rand_link.pl.pl into your
cgi-bin directory. If you don't know where your cgi-bin directory is, then
please ask your system administrator
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
You may need to rename rand_link.pl to rand_link.cgi. Again, your system
administrator will know if this is the case.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
You will probably need to turn on execute permissions to the file. You can
do this by running the command "chmod +x rand_link.pl" from your command
line. If you don't have command line access to your web server then there
will probably be an equivalent function in your file transfer program.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
Then, edit your HTML files and change all the links that you want to
be randomized to:
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<a href="http://your.host.com/cgi-bin/rand_link.pl">A mystery tour</a>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
This is just an example, so be sure to insert the correct URL of your
rand_link.pl installation.
