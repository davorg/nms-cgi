  <installation>
      <paragraph>
gallery.pl is installed simply by copying the file gallery.pl into your
cgi-bin directory. If you don't know where your cgi-bin directory is, then
please ask your system administrator
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
You may need to rename gallery.pl to gallery.cgi. Again, your system
administrator will know if this is the case.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
You will probably need to turn on execute permissions to the file. You can
do this by running the command "chmod +x gallery.pl" from your command
line. If you don't have command line access to your web server then there
will probably be an equivalent function in your file transfer program.
