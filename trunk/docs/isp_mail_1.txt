Hi,

I noticed from your page at:

  [% url %]

that you are recommending that your customers use Matt Wrights FormMail
program on their websites.  This program is subject to a number of
security advisory notices regarding it's vulnerability to being
exploited by spammers to send mail anonymously.  You might want to see:

     <http://www.securitytracker.com/alerts/2001/Mar/1001108.html>

for instance.   Fortunately, we have made a drop in replacement for the
offending program which is is available at:

     <http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/>

If you have any questions about the program please feel free to e-mail
nms-cgi-support@lists.sourceforge.net .
