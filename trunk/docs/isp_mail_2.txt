Hi,
I noticed from your page at:

That you have recognized the problem with Matt Wright's FormMail program
and have taken steps to avoid it's abuse by spammers on your customers
websites.  You might however be interested in the program we have made
available at:

   http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/

We have designed this version of FormMail from the ground up to be
secure against all of the vulnerabilities found in other similar
programs.  If you have any questions about this please feel free to
e-mail nms-cgi-support@lists.sourceforge.net .
