    <h2>About <span class="nms">nms</span></h2>

    <h3>What is <span class="nms">nms</span>?</h3>

    <p><span class="nms">nms</span> is a set of web programs that are intended
      as drop-in replacments for the scripts at 
      <a href="http://www.scriptarchive.com/">Matt's Script
	Archive</a>. Matt's Script Archive has been on the web since 1995. It 
      is a repository of web scripts written in Perl by a programmer called 
      Matt Wright.</p>

    <p>MSA is probably the most popular repository of web scripts currently
      available on the internet.</p>

    <h3>Why do we need a replacement for Matt's Script Archive?</h3>

    <p>The problem is that the scripts in Matt's Script Archive aren't
      very good. The scripts are well known amongst the Perl community to be
      badly written, buggy, and insecure. Anyone asking for support on Matt's
      scripts in any forum will be told in no uncertain terms that they
      shouldn't use his scripts.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately for some time there were no replacements for Matt's
      scripts that you would want people to use. In 2001, 
      <a href="http://london.pm.org">the London Perl Mongers</a> decided
      to address this problem and write a series of <i>drop-in</i>
      replacements for Matt's scripts. This project is the result.</p>

    <h3>So what exactly is <span class="nms">nms</span>?</h3>

    <p><span class="nms">nms</span> is a project hosted at
      <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. The project
      has drop-in replacements for all of Matt's scripts. This
      means that someone who uses one of Matt's scripts should be able to
      get the <span class="nms">nms</span> replacement and just drop it in
      in place of the original script. Everything should then work exactly
      as before, except that the user will sleep easier knowing that their
      web site is that little more secure.</p>

    <p>Note that these scripts are intended to replace Matt's scripts. 
      This means that their target audience is people who might not know 
      very much at all about Perl. Any contributed scripts must 
      therefore follow certain rules:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>They must run under Perl 5.004_04 or later. Any earlier Perl
	than this is pre-historic and can therefore be safely ignored.</li>

      <li>They must <b>not</b> use any non-standard Perl modules. I know
	this is a bit contentious, but I really think that the target
	audience will have problems installing modules from CPAN.</li>

      <li>They must run with no errors or warnings under <tt>use strict</tt>
	and <tt>-wT</tt>. One of the worst legacies of Matt's scripts is 
	that people use them to learn Perl. None of the MSA scripts
	use these constraints and therefore people copying them will
        learn bad habits. If people learn 
	Perl from NMS they will at least learn better programming 
	habits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><span class="nms">nms</span> as recommended by Matt Wright</h3>

    <p>In May 2002, Matt Wright gave the
      <a href="http://www.scriptarchive.com/">MSA web site</a> a major 
      redesign. He included a 
      <a href="http://www.scriptarchive.com/nms.html">page</a> about 
      <span class="nms">nms</span>. Here are a couple of 
      extracts.</p>
    <blockquote><i>While the free code found at my web site has not evolved 
      much in recent years, the general programming practices and standards 
      of CGI programs have. nms is an attempt by very active programmers in 
      the Perl community to bring the quality of code for these types of 
      programs up to date and eliminate some of the bad programming practices 
      and bugs found in the existing Matt's Script Archive 
      code.</i></blockquote>
    <blockquote><i>I would highly recommend downloading the nms versions if 
      you wish to learn CGI programming. The code you find at Matt's Script 
      Archive is not representative of how even I would code these 
      days.</i></blockquote>
    <p>I call that a good result :)</p>

    <h3>Why the name <span class="nms">nms</span>?</h3>

    <p><span class="nms">nms</span> originally stood for something that
      was pretty derogatory to Matt Wright and his scripts. Whilst I still
      believe that his scripts should not be used, I decided that the name
      of the project shouldn't be so negative. Unfortunately, by the time
      I'd reached that decision, the name <span class="nms">nms</span>
      had pretty much stuck and I didn't want to change it.</p>

    <p>There was some <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=113073">discussion</a> 
      on <a href="http://perlmonks.org">PerlMonks</a>
      about alternative meanings for <span class="nms">nms</span>, and
      whilst I like many of those ideas, I think that 
      <span class="nms">nms</span> probably doesn't actually stand for 
      anything.</p>
