    <h2><span class="nms">nms</span> support</h2>

    <p>This page gives you access to various resources that will help
      you to fix problems that you are having with our programs. Please
      work through these suggestions in the order that they are given
      here.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> The resources on this page are aimed at people who
      are installing and configuring one of our programs on their own
      web site. If you are not doing this, then this page will not be
      useful for you and you should <a href="support2.html">go here</a>
      instead.</p>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <p>You probably are not the first person to have the problem that
      you're having. Solutions to the most common problems are in our
      <a href="faq_prob.html">FAQs</a> (Frequently Asked Questions).
      Please read that before asking any questions on the support list.</p>

    <p>Note that the <i>most</i> common question we are asked is the one
      about getting an error that says "too late for -T option" when 
      running our programs on a Windows web server. That question is
      discussed in great detail <a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/faq_prob.html#I%20am%20getting%20the%20Error%20%27%20Too%20late%20for%20%22%2DT%22%20option%27%2C%20what%20can%20I%20do%20%3F">
      in the FAQ</a> and questions on this will be referred back there
      unless you demonstrate that you have read that section.</p>

    <h3>Mailing List Archives</h3>

    <p>Even if your question isn't asked frequently, it's still very
      likely that it has been asked before. All of the posts to our 
      support mailing list are archived, so it's well worth checking
      through <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=nms-cgi-support">
      the archives</a> to see if it has been discussed before.</p>

    <p>Yes, our archives contain a lot of spam. Unfortunately we need to
      make our email address as accessible as possible and that means that
      we end up on a lot of spammer lists. We are working on ways to cut
      down on the amount of spam that we recieve.</p>

    <h3>Basic Web Program Debugging</h3>

    <p>We're aware that many of the people who use our programs are not
      programmers, so we don't expect you to be experts in debugging web
      programs. However, there are a number of simple things that you can
      check. It's surprising what a large percentage of problems are
      caused by one of these errors.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you transfered the program to your web server, did you
        make the transfer in "text" mode?</li>

      <li>Is the path to "perl" in the first line of the program correct?
        We have configured it to be the most common value, but your web
        server may have the Perl compiler in a slightly unusual place.
        You'll need to check this with your system adminstrators.</li>

      <li>Are the permissions correct? The program will need to be 
        executable by the web server user on your system. It's hard to
        give any more specific advice, as the specifics can vary from 
        system to system. Your system adminstrators will know what is 
        required on your system.</li>

      <li>Is the path to "sendmail" correct? Our formmail program uses
        another program called "sendmail" to actually send the email.
        It's possible to tell formmail where to find this program by
        setting the $mailprog variable. Once again, your system
        adminstrators can tell you exactly what this should be set to.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Latest Version</h3>

    <p>Most of our programs are constantly being improved. If you're not
      using the most recent version of our program then one of our first
      suggestions will probably be that you upgrade. So it's probably a
      good idea to try that anyway. You can always get the latest versions
      of all of our programs from <a href="scripts.shtml">this site</a>.</p>

    <p>It's particularly worth noting that the versions of our programs
      that are distributed by other sites are not guaranteed to be up to
      date.</p>

    <h3>Reporting Problems</h3>

    <p>If your problem isn't discussed in the FAQ or the mailing list 
      archives then please use the form below to send an email to our
      support mailing list. We only ask that you are follow a few simple
      suggestions when posting to the list.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>As discussed above, mails to the list are publically archived
        so that other people can read them. This means that you shouldn't
        include in your email any thing that you wouldn't want to be
        public knowledge. This particularly applies to usernames and
        passwords.</li>

      <li>Please don't attach the whole of our program to the email. Many
        off our programs are pretty large and we already know what they
        look like. We only need to see the bits that you have edited. In
        most cases, that will just be the "user configuration" section.
        It's also a good idea to include the version number of the program
        that you are using. That's found at the top of all of our
        programs.</li>

      <li>Similarly, it's generally a bad idea to send us the whole of a
        complex HTML page. It's a much better idea to just send us a link
        to the page.</li>

      <li>Try to include as much useful information as possible in your
        email. Just saying "it doesn't work" isn't much help to us. Please
        tell us exactly what unexpected behaviour you are seeing. Send us
        the exact text of the error message that you are seeing. If you're
        getting a generic "500 error" or "internal error" page then there
        will usually be more useful information in the web server error
        log, please send us that too (note that we can't tell you where
        your web server error log is, as that's down to the configuration
        of your web server).</li>

      <li>All of the error messages that you will see are plain text.
        This means that you should be able to paste the text of the 
        message into the your email message. There's never any need to 
        send us an image file. So please don't do that.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you follow all of these suggestions then we'll be happy to help
      you in any way that we can. However, you should realise that the
      <span class="nms">nms</span> project is run by volunteers. We all
      have day-jobs too so we can't guarantee any particular level of
      support.</p>

    <p>You can send an email to the support team by filling in the form
      below.</p>
