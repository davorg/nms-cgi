This is an automated test set for NMS, intended
primarily for use by NMS developers.


Installation
============

Copy tests/bin/nmstests to somewhere in your path and
edit it to suit your system.


Functional Tests
================

To run all functional tests currently defined for the
formmail package (for example) run the command:

 $ nmstests formmail


Regression Tests
================

Every test run gives rise to a directory containing a 
file for each test, and these files record the script's
exact observed behavior.  The example above creates
files in the directory $NMS_PUT_RESULTS/new/formmail/.

To perform regression tests: 

Run tests against all the scripts when you think they're
working well.

Rename $NMS_PUT_RESULTS/new to $NMS_PUT_RESULTS/good

Make changes to scripts.

Run the tests again.

The command:

 $ diff -ur $NMS_PUT_RESULTS/good $NMS_PUT_RESULTS/new

... will show you all the effects of your changes, in
far more detail than you could ever want.
