<p>Frequently Asked Questions about the <i>nms</i> CGI programs </p>
<p>&lt;-- $Date: 2004/08/15 14:12:55 $ --&gt;</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This document seeks to answer some of the questions that people might
want to ask about the <i>nms</i> project and the programs therein.</p>
<h3><a id="What_is_this_i_nms_i_thing_all_about">What is this <i>nms</i> thing all about?</a></h3>

<p><i>nms</i> is an attempt to provide replacements for all of the scripts from
Matt's Script Archive. MSA is probably the most well-known archive of
CGI programs currently available on the web. Among the Perl community,
the MSA scripts are known to be badly-written, buggy and insecure.</p>
<p><i>nms</i> was started when a group of Perl programmers got tired of telling
people not to use Matt's programs and getting the reply "But what shall I
use instead?"</p>
<h3><a id="But_there_are_perfectly_good_programs_already_out_there_why_bother">But there are perfectly good programs already out there, why bother?</a></h3>

<p>Actually, there aren't really.</p>
<p>Most CGI programs that are available for free download really aren't very
good at all. Most of them seem to be written by people with very little
knowledge of Perl.</p>
<p>Many of the developers on <i>nms</i> have been very active in the Perl community
for years. They know Perl and CGI programming very well.</p>
<p>The problems with most other CGI programs, fall into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The programs are insecure. Putting a CGI program on your web site is very 
risky. It means that you are allowing anyone to run a program on your web
server. Unless these programs have been written very carefully, you may
be allowing unscrupulous people (known as crackers) to gain access to more
information than you intend. Eventually the crackers may be able to take
control of your web server.</p>
<p>Perl makes it very easy to write secure programs. Unfortunately, most CGI
program authors don't seem to know this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The programs are buggy. Many of the other programs have had no kind of
code review. This means that they often still have bugs in which can cause
problems on your web site. You may be the first person to discover this
bug. The support you get from the authors of these programs can be very
patchy. I have never received a reply from Matt Wright when I've reported a
bug in his scripts.</p>
<p>The <i>nms</i> project has a large number of developers, therefore each line of
code has been seen by many people. The chances of bugs is much reduced.
Additionally, we have a dedicated mailing list to deal with support issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The programs are badly written. Whilst many people simply install these
programs and never look at the code, others will read CGI program code as
a way to learn to write their own CGI programs. We therefore feel it is
important that our scripts reflect the best Perl coding practices. Others
don't share our views and many people have learned very bad coding habits
from reading Matt Wright's code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="What_does_Matt_Wright_think_about_all_this">What does Matt Wright think about all this?</a></h3>

<p>Matt has a page on his web site which is generally very positive about
<i>nms</i>.</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.scriptarchive.com/nms.html">http://www.scriptarchive.com/nms.html</a>&gt;</p>
<h3><a id="What_programs_are_available_in_the_collection">What programs are available in the collection?</a></h3>

<p>The exact list will increase over time. Here is the list of what we have

<h3><a id="How_are_the_programs_licensed">How are the programs licensed?</a></h3>

<p>The programs are licensed in the same way as Perl itself. That is you are 
free to choose between the GNU Public License
&lt;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a>&gt; or the Artistic License
&lt;<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/misc/Artistic.html">http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/misc/Artistic.html</a>&gt;.</p>
<h3><a id="But_I_have_programs_that_do_the_same_thing_already_why_change_them">But I have programs that do the same thing already, why change them?</a></h3>

<p>Because the programs you may already use aren't as good as these. See
"<a href="#But_there_are_perfectly_good_programs_already_out_there,_why_bother?">/But there are perfectly good programs already out there, why bother?</a>"
above for more details.</p>
<h3><a id="Why_do_you_keep_calling_them_programs_and_not_scripts">Why do you keep calling them programs and not scripts?</a></h3>

<p>The two terms can be interchangeable. We like to use the term "program"
as it carries an implication that the code has been designed more carefully.
The term "scripts" can imply that the code has just been "thrown together"
with no real thought. For CGI programs, this can be very dangerous.</p>
<h3><a id="Why_Perl_and_not_Python_Tcl_Ruby">Why Perl and not (Python|Tcl|Ruby)?</a></h3>

<p>Because we like Perl :)</p>
<p>But also because Perl is still the most commonly used programming language
for writing CGI programs.</p>
<h3><a id="Why_CGI_and_not_PHP_ASP_Java_Servlets">Why CGI and not (PHP|ASP|Java Servlets)?</a></h3>

<p>Because CGI is still the most commonly used architecture for dynamic web
pages - despite what you might hear from the marketing departments at
Sun or Microsoft.</p>
<h3><a id="What_s_with_all_this_XML_stuff_Shouldn_t_the_programs_output_HTML">What's with all this XML stuff? Shouldn't the programs output HTML?</a></h3>

<p>All of our scripts output valid XHTML. XHMTL is the newest standard for
HTML. It replaces HTML 4.01. We strongly believe that by adhering to 
published standards, our web pages will be more easily viewed by as large
a range of browsers as possible.</p>
<p>XHTML is largely a case of tightening up on some of the bad habits that
HTML let you get away with. All tags must be explicitly closed and all
presentation information is stored in a stylesheet.</p>
