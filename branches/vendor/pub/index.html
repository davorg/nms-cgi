    <h1>Not Matt's Scripts</h1>

    <h2>What are Matt's scripts?</h2>

    <p><a href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/">Matt's Script
	Archive</a> has been on the web since 1995. It is a repository
      of CGI scripts written in Perl by a programmer called Matt Wright.</p>

    <p>MSA is probably the most popular repository of CGI scripts currently
      available on the internet.</p>

    <h2>Why is this "Not Matt's Scripts"?</h2>

    <p>The problem is that Matt is not exactly the world's best Perl 
      programmer. His scripts are well known amongst the community to be
      badly written, buggy and insecure. Anyone asking for support on Matt's
      scripts in any forum will be told in no uncertain terms that they
      shouldn't use his scripts.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately until now there have been no replacements for Matt's
      scripts that you would want people to use. Some months ago, 
      <a href="http://london.pm.org">the London Perl Mongers</a> decided
      to address this problem and write a series of <i>drop-in</i>
      replacements for Matt's scripts. This project is still on-going,
      but in meantime I've decided that it's worth actually getting some
      code out there that people can use. Hence this page.</p>

    <h2>So what is "Not Matt's Scripts"</h2>

    <p>This is very much a "work in progress" I welcome comments,
      enhancements and bug fixes to the scripts here. Also if you have
      a drop-in replacement for one of Matt's scripts that isn't here
      yet, I'd be happy to add it to my list.</p>

    <p>For all enquiries, comments or offers of help, please contact me
      at <a href="mailto:nms@dave,org.uk">nms@dave.org.uk</a>.</p>

    <p>Please note that these scripts are intended to replace Matt's
      scripts. This means that their target audience is people who might
      not know very much at all about Perl. Any contributed scripts must 
      therefore follow certain rules:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>They must run under Perl 5.004_04 or later. Any earlier Perl
	than this is pre-historic and can therefore be safely ignored.</li>

      <li>They must <b>not</b> use any non-standard Perl modules. I know
	this is a bit contentious, but I really think that the target
	audience will have problems installing modules from CPAN.</li>

      <li>They must run with no errors or warnings under <tt>use strict</tt>
	and <tt>-wT</tt>. One of the worst legacies of Matt's scripts is 
	that people use them to learn Perl. And Matt is a complete 
	stranger to programming under these contraints. If people learn 
	Perl from NMS they will at least learn better programming 
	habits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>So what's here?</h2>

    <p>Did I mention this was a work in progress? Here are the scripts that
      are currently available. Others will follow in the next few weeks.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Most of the docs included with the scripts is a bit 
      rough and ready and could use some tidying up. If you'd like to 
      help, please get in touch with me.</p>
