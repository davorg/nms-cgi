The Random Image Displayer will allow you to call on different images each 
time your page is reloaded and accessed.  The Random Image Displayer consists 
of two files, the rand_image.pl and README.

     rand_image.pl - The perl script that calls on the random image.
     README - This file (Installation instructions)

This is one of my more simple scripts, yet still very useful for its purpose.  
Below is a description of how to configure the files:

RAND_IMAGE.PL -
   This is the main file and the one that is called upon every time your 
page is loaded.  You will need to place this file in your server's cgi-bin and 
give users the permission to read/execute this file. (chmod 755 or chmod a+rx)  
There are also several variables you will have to define:

   # Define Necessary Variables
   $basedir = "";
       This is the http address and base directory that your pictures
       are placed in.  This is in url form.  The filenames you 
       specify will be appended to this address.  Examples Below.
       @files = ("","");
       These are all of your files placed into array.  The filenames 
       should be reflective of the location of the files relative 
       to your $basedir. Examples Below.

   # Choose Options
   $uselog = 1;    # 1 = YES; 0 = NO
       You can enable the usage of a short log, which will simply log 
       the name of each file as it is accessed.  Not very fancy, but 
       it can be useful.
   $logfile = "";
       The system path to your log file and where you want it kept.  
       Keep in mind that this log file must be placed in a world 
       writable directory.  If you don't create a log file, but 
       point the path to a world writeable directory and give it a 
       false filename, the script will create the file for you.  This 
       is not a required variable if you turn off $uselog.

README -
        All you have to do with this file is read it!  :)

Example:
Let's say I have 5 files.  They are  all in a root directory called: 
/home/mattw/public_html/, but from there they branch out to:
pics/funny.gif, nature/waterfalls.gif, pics/cool.gif, nature/tree.gif, and 
pics/www.gif.  Where pics/ and nature/ are directories that these images are 
located in.  Your variables should show as follows:

$basedir = "http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/";
@files = ("pics/funny.gif","nature/waterfalls.gif","pics/cool.gif",
          "nature/tree.gif","pics/www.gif");

It's that easy!

How do I implement this in my pages?
   This file can be used in your pages in one of the following syntaxes.  
It can do backgrounds, or just plain image references.  To activate it do the 
following:
<img src="http://www.ser.ver/cgi-bin/rand_image.pl">
   This is when you want it to call a random image.
<body background="http://www.ser.ver/cgi-bin/rand_image.pl">
   This is when you want it to call a random background.

Things to be careful of:
   If you are using it as a random background program, you will want to 
make sure that all of your backgrounds will work with the specified colors.  
In other words, if you have a dark and a light image in your random image path 
it will be hard to find a text color to work in both instances.
