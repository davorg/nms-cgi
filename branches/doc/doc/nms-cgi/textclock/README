TextClock is a Perl CGI script which is meant to be run from Server Side 
Includes. When this script is implemented, it can be used to show browsers 
several variations of the current time and/or date.

There are two files included with this script:
    1) README 	- This file; includes detailed installation 
                  instructions.
    2) textclock.pl - The Perl script which generates the headers 
                  and sends the current time and/or date to 
                  your user.

Should you encounter any problems running this script, such as Method Not
Implemented, try changing the name of the program to nph-textclock.cgi, 
as some servers require the use of .cgi extensions.  Otherwise, this 
script must be placed in your cgi-bin.  There are several variables which
must be edited in the textclock.pl script.

TEXTCLOCK.PL -

    There are up to nine variables in the textclock.pl script, however
    if you wish to receive the default display, you need not edit any
    of them.  You can mix and match all of these options and see which
    kind of clock you like the best.  You can get the clock to display
    only the day of the week, only the date, only the time, everything
    or make up your own combination!

    $Display_Week_Day = '1';
        If this option is set to '1', the day of the week will be 
        displayed; Possible Values: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
        Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Setting this option
        to '0' will suppress the printing of the Day of the Week.

    $Display_Month = '1';
        If this option is set to '1', the month will be printed.
        Possible values include: January, February, March, April, May,
        June, July, August, September, October, November and December.
        If this option is set to '0', the month will not be displayed.

    $Display_Month_Day = '1';
        If this option is set to '1', the day of the month is
        displayed, containing a value from 01 - 31.  Setting this to
        '0' will hide the Day of the Month.

    $Display_Year = '1';
        If this option is set to '1', the four digit year is 
        displayed, and it can be hidden by setting this to '0'.

    $Display_Time = '1';
        If this option is set to '1', a twenty four hour clock is
        displayed.  Otherwise, if it is set to '0', it is supressed.

    $Display_Time_Zone = '1';
        Setting this to '1' allows users to your site to know what
        time zone the date is being displayed from.
