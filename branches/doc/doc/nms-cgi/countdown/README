The Countdown script is a somewhat simple script, which takes the time you give 
it and tells you the number of years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds 
until that event will occur.  More details on how to use this script are below.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT CONTAINS:

This script comes with 3 different files:
1) countdown.pl - The Perl script which does the calculation 
                  of the time until an event will occur.
2) README - The file that does all the explaining.
3) countdown.html - An example of ways to incorporate 
                    countdown.pl and use it properly.


You will have to do some minimal configuration of the countdown.pl file:

COUNTDOWN.PL -
The countdown.pl file is the main file in this package.  This file needs to 
be placed in the server's cgi-bin or have its name changed to countdown.cgi.  
Keep in mind the latter option only works should your server be set up to 
treat all .cgi files in a script manner.  If you are not sure about this, 
consult your system administrator.  Inside the countdown.pl file you can do 
one of two things:

1) If you plan to just call the same date every time from this script, change 
the @from_date variable to the date you want it to countdown to.  This can 
include all the way up to seconds.  The format for this should look like:

   @from_date = (yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm,ss);

Where:
   yyyy - The Year in Four Digits.
   mm   - The first mm is the month number from 1-12.
   dd   - The Day of the month.  Values range from 1-31.
   hh   - The hour of the day.  Values range from 0-23.
   mm   - The second mm is the minute of the hour from 0-59.
   ss   - The ss stands for seconds and the value can range from 0-59.

2) If you plan to call different dates via a html page, you don't have 
to worry about setting any variables inside the script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO I IMPLEMENT THIS?!

1) If you have defined the @from_date in the countdown.pl file and you wish to 
   only call the same value each time, you can simply do the following:

   <a href="http://your.server/cgi-bin/countdown.pl">Countdown to ...</a>

   When the user clicks on this they will be taken to a cgi generated page that
   tells them the countdown status.

2) Should you want to use this counter for various countdown you can also call 
   a specific date directly from the link, in the same fashion as you would 
   have defined @from_date. (See Above for info on how to define @from_date.)
   Let's say I want to countdown to my birthday in 2002.  My birthday is 
   September 7, so I would do something like:

    <a href="http://my.server/cgi-bin/countdown.pl?2002,9,7,0,0,0">Countdown 
    to my birthday!</a>

3)  Allow users to countdown to their own dates!  If you want to do this you 
    would use the following syntax:

    <FORM METHOD=GET ACTION="http://your.server/cgi-bin/countdown.pl">
    <INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME=""><P>
    <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT>
    </FORM>

    Then when the user types in his/her query the program will generate an 
    automatic response.  Make sure to let your users and yourself know that 
    the format for the query must match the exact same definition as @from_date. 
    (See Above for info on how to define @form_date.)

ADVANCED FEATURES OF COUNTDOWN!

In Some situations it may be impractical to count out to seconds.  Or maybe if 
you are counting down to something closer than year, you will want to leave 
out the year portion of the countdown since it is only going to be 0 all the 
tie anyways.  Or maybe the same goes for month, day, etc...  Countdown has a 
built in feature to allow you to do this.  Instead of defining all categories 
in @from_date you can do the following:

1) Say I want to leave out the year in the countdown to my birthday (From the 
   example above.) I could also do this:

    <a href="http://my.server/cgi-bin/countdown.pl?XX,4,15,0,0,0">Countdown
    to my birthday!</a>

   When the user gets the returned html document, the # of years will not be 
   shown.  You can put an 'XX' in any of the fields (year, month, day, hour, 
   minute, second) and it will disregard that amount of time.

2) You can also define the same way inside of the countdown.pl.  If you are 
   using a standard countdown, meaning that you see no need for  multiple 
   countdowns, you can set your @from_date in your Perl script to reflect this 
   (This concept is also mentioned above).  You can substitute in 'XX' for any 
   amount of time you don't want. (Be it year, month, day, hour, minute, or
   second)
